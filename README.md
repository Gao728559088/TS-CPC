TS-CPC: Trajectory Similarity Measurement with Contrastive Predictive Coding
This repository contains the official implementation of TS-CPC, a self-supervised trajectory similarity measurement framework based on Contrastive Predictive Coding (CPC). TS-CPC is designed to handle complex trajectory datasets efficiently while delivering robust and accurate similarity measurements.

Features
Spatiotemporal Refinement and Augmentation Module (SRA-M):
Includes two novel methods:

Sliding Window Linear Interpolation (SW-LI): Interpolates additional trajectory points to preserve structural features and enhance model performance.
Trajectory Detour Point Offset (TDPO): Simulates noise and generates detour trajectories to improve robustness and adaptability.
Shallow Feature Extraction Module (SFEM):
Extracts key motion features like speed and direction to capture spatiotemporal dynamics.

Contrastive Predictive Coding (CPC):
Utilizes future trajectory prediction to learn compact and effective trajectory representations.

Key Results
Datasets:
Achieves state-of-the-art results on:

Grab-Posisi
GeoLife
Performance:
Demonstrates advantages in trajectory similarity measurement, including improved representation quality, computational efficiency, and robustness.
